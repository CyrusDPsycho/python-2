#This a GA exmaple searching for the best recipe for making cookies.
#It is consisted of sugar and flour as two major raw material and ingore
#anything else.The quantity of sugar and flour range from 1 to 9 respectively
#and the quality of the cookie is measured from 0 to 9,9 represents best
#In this algorithm,we choose a recipe as chromosome and make sugar and
#flour as two genes as this chromosome.The initial population size is 1 and so
#crossover is cancelled here and muation is the main method for evolution.
#Each time we choose one cookie randomly in the population to mutate.
